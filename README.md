- **`stats.py`**: Contains helper functions:
    - `get_num_words(file)`: Returns the total word count.
    - `num_dict(file)`: Returns a dictionary of character frequencies.
    - `sort_dict(nums_dict)`: Converts and sorts the character frequency dictionary into a list.

## Notes
- Ensure that the text file used is properly formatted and readable.
- Non-alphabetical characters are automatically ignored when generating the character frequency report.
